## Expansion Algorithm

The results of expanding the address `1C9KA8hWUuASCdDq1EPB7PmcnFNqhb1so2` over 2 hops are shown. The green nodes represent addresses that have been explored during the graph expansion, the largest red node represents the illicit seed node, and the gray nodes are transactions between addresses. The direction of the edges indicates the flow of funds (`(addr -> tx)` is an input, `(tx -> addr)` is an output), and the layout of the graph shows past transactions at the top moving to future transactions at the bottom.
